# Case-Assistant

Case Assistant is a tool designed to allow Critical Situations Managers (CSM) to manage thier cases on a very in-depth, detailed manner. 

This tool imports emails from Outlook related to cases (SR). Additionally, it can create and send out emails from the application, forward notes into the pre-built tool built in Dynamics by the parent company.

Additionally, you can keep track of your contacts, and chat with them directly through links created to open Teams and Skype for Business directly to the agent / contact in question. Labor tracking and communication logs are also fully implemented.
